\subsection{Constraint Programming}
Another approach for solving the Generalised Assignment Problem, which the \textit{scheduling task} poses, is Constraint Programming. However, in order to arrive at Constraint Programming\footnote{Constraint Programming is a somewhat odd nomenclature, as \textit{programming} here refers to 'the process of scheduling' rather than in the sense of a computer programming language.}, we will first argue, without a complete theoretical deep dive, that the Generalised Assignment Problem can be reformulated into the binary case of an integer problem. A binary integer problem takes the form\cite{Integer-Programming-Book} 
\begin{align*}
    \text{max} &\sum_{i = 1}^m \sum_{j = 1}^n c_{ij} \cdot x_{ij}
    \\
    \text{subject to} &\sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij} \cdot x_{ij} \leq b \qquad &\text{for} \quad i = 1, \hdots, m
    \\
    &\sum_{i = 1}^m x_{ij} \leq 1 \qquad &\text{for} \quad j = 1, \hdots, n
    \\
    &x \in \{0, 1\}^{m \times n}.
\end{align*}
This formulation gives way to a Boolean Satisfiability Problem (BSAT), a subfield of Constraint Programming, which we can attempt to solve with a SAT solver. In the following sections, we will elaborate on different algorithms employed by SAT solvers.
