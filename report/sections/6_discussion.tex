\section{Discussion}
We started this project by agreeing to provide OUH with a digital replacement for their current, manually transcribed taskboard (as detailed in \autoref{sec:Digital-Taskboard}). While true that this problem, on its own, couldn't provide a sufficient academic foundation for a Master's thesis in AI, we nevertheless made the grave error of underestimating just how cumbersome\footnote{Which, to her great credit, our supervisor had actually warned us about.} of a task digitalising the taskboard could be.
\\
\\
At a glance, digitalising the taskboard seemed no more complex than merging two 2D datasets, and we are still convinced it could have been were it not for OUH's currently in-place payroll and calendar overview system, HosInfo, serving as an ever-persistent thorn in our side. While the HosInfo implementation could be criticised plentily for its sluggish and featureless backend\footnote{Which we admittedly never had access to but only have seen in parsing when been guided through the system by the OUH staff.}, beyond the shadow of a doubt, our biggest gripe with it was its data handling or, rather, lack thereof. Not only does HosInfo make OUH's data nearly inaccessible by storing text data as pictures, but they also enforce no data formatting on their users. Additionally, rather than designing a solution capable of serving the greater planning effort at OUH, they have delivered a solution to a smaller subproblem while completely disregarding even the slightest notion of compatibility with the rest of OUH's IT environment.
\\
Such software makes it nigh impossible for OUH, not even to mention other external providers such as ourselves, to develop other solutions that need access to their data without forcing the end user to document everything many times over.
\\ 
However, HosInfo isn't the only third-party provider that is guilty of contributing to OUH's messy, tangled, and, at the same time, disconnected IT stack. We can only speculate on the reasons behind how it ends up as such. It might be due to the Danish and European procurement legislation~\cite{Udbudsloven, EU-Procurement-Legislation}, or in part due to a lack of technical insight at OUH, which limits them in seeing the greater scope of their administrative challenges. Nevertheless, it culminates in a system comprising a slew of individual IT solutions, which can't share data nor benefit from what each provides.
\\
Trying to work around this constant impediment is perfectly summarised by this single response to our questionnaire, which loosely translated into English would be:
\begin{center}
 \textit{We have many systems that can do quite a lot, but not always in conjunction with each other, and most of the time, you have to work across several applications.}
\end{center}
While (our interpretation of) this statement perfectly encapsulates our immense frustration after six months of efforts of working with (or around) the Danish healthcare sector's IT, we can still scarcely imagine having to work with it on a daily basis. Therefore, we thoroughly believe that a more cohesive and all-encompassing platform would be the right move.
\\
We envision a cloud-based platform with data formatting requirements which can serve data to the correct users. Such a platform should have a single standardised user interface (UI) and allow the administrative workers to extract and log data for their corresponding hospitals (or other clinical facilities). It should facilitate an API allowing approved independent third-party providers to create individual software solutions that could work off of this platform. Such a platform would immediately eliminate any need to log data multiple times, as it would all be gathered in one place. Furthermore, if such a platform enforced a UI design guide onto third-party providers and required them to implement their solution onto the platform, it would save the healthcare personnel from having multiple credentials and remembering different layouts for each and every single individual application.
\\
This idea would require a lot from the IT sectors of the Danish healthcare sector; in turn, we also hope that it would be easier to maintain if all of it was gathered onto a single platform, with the single uniform goal of facilitating more seamless implementation of IT solutions.
\\
However, this isn't exactly 'new tech', as "Danske Regioner" in 2024 proposed a 'Danish Healthcare Cloud'~\cite{Den-Reg-digitalisation}. The referenced note touches upon many of the same topics as we have just detailed. Rather than feeling amiss for only arriving at the same conclusion as somebody else had found way before us, we will instead let it enforce our belief that such a restructuring wouldn't simply be an improvement; it is a requirement.
\\
\\
This brings us nicely along to our next point, for although, in all likelihood, we wouldn't be qualified to implement such a platform, we did attempt to build The Scheduling Assistant tool, which we believe could have been a good starting point for OUH, at least.
\\
As mentioned, we didn't believe digitalising the OUH taskboard would be academically sufficient; therefore, we also pursued the scheduling task. We believed that we could implement this side-by-side with the digital taskboard. While we still think it technically feasible, as it has been done before~\cite{you-but-better} (and to a way greater extent), much like for the digital taskboard, we ran into multiple unforeseen difficulties.
