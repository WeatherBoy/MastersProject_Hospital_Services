\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}
Due to the uncharacteristic way by which we approached this report, we have included this theory section as a testament to five years of prior education. We have still tried to keep it somewhat relevant to the main tasks as described; however, as we initially deemed constraint programming a grey area verging more to the side of mathematical modelling than artificial intelligence, we have included an extensive section on genetic algorithms, that we admittedly do not put into practice.
\\
Nevertheless, of the three main tasks explored in this thesis, developing a \emph{scheduling assistance tool} (which we henceforth will refer to as the '\emph{scheduling task}') required the most mathematical approach. 
The following sections explore different theoretical approaches that might yield a satisfactory solution to the scheduling task.
