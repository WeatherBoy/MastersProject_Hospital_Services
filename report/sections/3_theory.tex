\section{Theory}
Of the three main tasks explored in this thesis, developing a \textit{scheduling assistance tool}, which we henceforth will refer to as the '\textit{scheduling task}', required the most mathematical approach. 
The following sections explore different theoretical approaches that might yield a satisfactory solution to the \textit{scheduling task}.
