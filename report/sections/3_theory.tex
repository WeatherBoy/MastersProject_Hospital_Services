\section{Theory}
Of the three main tasks explored in this thesis, developing a \emph{scheduling assistance tool} (which we henceforth will refer to as the '\emph{scheduling task}') required the most mathematical approach. 
The following sections explore different theoretical approaches that might yield a satisfactory solution to the \emph{scheduling task}.
