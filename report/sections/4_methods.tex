\section{Methodology}
\subsection{First Steps - The Questionnaire}
Rather than researching some obscure nook or cranny of mathematics, this project was initially motivated by a desire to try and implement 5 years of education in order to assist with some current real-world problems. From prior work, we hypothesised that there might be quite a handful of such problems within the Danish healthcare sector. As such, we laid the groundwork in March of 2024 by sending out a questionnaire, which can be seen in appendix \autoref{fig:questionnaire_healthcare_personnel}, to \textbf{Rigshospitalet}, \textbf{The Hospital of Hvidovre}, \textbf{The regional Hospital of Northern Jutland}, \textbf{The University Hospital of Aalborg}, \textbf{Hospital unit Midt}, \textbf{The Hospital of Holb√¶k} and \textbf{The department of orthopaedic surgery at the University Hospital of Odense}. This was met with quite varying responses. Most deemed that answering such a questionnaire would be an abhorrent misuse of their personnel's limited time. This, admittedly, left us a bit discouraged. However, we still received a total of 39 answers from medical professionals.
\\
The questionnaire consisted of two questions\footnote{With the option to add your name and/or mail for possible further inquiry.}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the biggest and most frequent problem in your daily life as a healthcare professional?
    \item What do you think is the biggest and most frequent problem in the daily life of your patients?
\end{itemize}
The responses about the daily life and tasks of healthcare professionals varied significantly, but they could likely be summarised as a general dissatisfaction with the understaffed and underfunded state of the healthcare sector.
\\
Many complained about the intricate journaling processes - documenting the patients' treatment pathways, reading through a lot of unnecessary documentation and documenting the same thing twice. 
\\
There was a plethora of replies criticising the IT systems currently in place. Complaining that they either didn't work, were too slow or kept crashing. Additionally, one respondee noted that they have a lot of programs that advertise useful functionality, but because they aren't integrated with all the other individual solutions, the healthcare staff end up having to open multiple programs documenting the same data many times over.
\\
Some mentioned that there are a lot of wrongful queries to the emergency line that have to be redirected. It was also added that a filter or automatic redirection might save a lot of critical time.
\\
Finally, the vast majority of responses were aimed at a lack of resources. This included being understaffed, resulting in insufficient time to care for patients and individual staff members being assigned too many tasks. Additionally, there was a shortage of critical inventory, such as bed space and essential medical equipment. Moreover, the existing equipment was often old or outdated due to budget cuts.
\\
\\
The responses regarding the everyday problems of patients weren't nearly as varied. These were mainly regarding long waiting times and a lack of transparency. Out of 39 responses, 12 mentioned that patients had expressed concerns about unclear treatment pathways. Additionally, 18 out of 39 responses indicated that patients had complained about the length of the waiting times. Lastly, a handful of respondents (approximately 6) mentioned that their patients feel overlooked, which may also indicate an understaffed healthcare sector.
\\
\\
After reading the responses to our questionnaire and working in tandem with the healthcare sector for roughly six months, it has become undoubtedly apparent that the healthcare sector is in dire need of a digital revolution. A plethora of tasks could be expedited seamlessly without contributing additional burdens to the medical personnel if only proper digital solutions were implemented. However, we would have been unable to work on any practical application within the healthcare sector if all responses we had received were equally uninclined to collaborate. Therefore, we were overjoyed when the University Hospital of Odense (OUH) reached out with an incredibly accommodating response.

\subsection{The Digital Taskboard}
OUH responded that their department of Orthopaedic surgery uses a whiteboard as a daily taskboard. A picture of the current whiteboard is shown in \autoref{fig:Whiteboard-Taskboard}. However, this whiteboard is being drawn up daily by manually transcribing data from two distinct spreadsheets. OUH  informed us that the process usually takes 10-20 minutes, time that could be better spent on more critical tasks by the clinical staff, and as such, they wished for a digital replacement for the whiteboard. Therefore, this thesis began with the seemingly straightforward task of merging two 2D datasets and visualising them on a screen comparable to a whiteboard.
\\
For clarity, we would like to note that the two spreadsheets are separated purely for administrative purposes; the separation doesn't add any additional dimensionality. Hence, it can still be displayed without loss of dimensionality on a plane like a whiteboard or screen.

\end{figure}

The two spreadsheets, which need to be merged in order to arrive at the correct data, consisted of a \emph{ward assignment chart}, in the form of a Microsoft Excel file and a web application made by a third party called HosInfo. A snippet of the ward assignment chart can be seen in \autoref{fig:wac-snippet}, and a snippet of the HosInfo interface can be seen in \autoref{fig:HosInfo-snippet}.
\\
The immediate issue was that the HosInfo data was inaccessible. The HosInfo application (which we will refer to onwards as HosInfo) didn't have an API, and it only has two access levels: surface-level access for viewing the data and full administrative control. As such, our only option was to scrape the HTML pages from HosInfo. Scraping was a wholly new endeavour for us, so at first, we tried using Python's inherent \texttt{requests} package. Here, we injected \emph{cookies} and a \emph{header} containing our login information. However, it would soon prove that what seemed to be a bug at first, was actually just not an automatic solution at all. The injected information would have to be updated regularly with a manual login for this approach to work. Therefore, we made a switch to the open-source, third-party tool \texttt{selenium}. \texttt{selenium} works by instantiating a WebDriver, which can automatically drive the browser. In short, this meant that we gave it instructions to navigate separately to the three specified text elements for login input and fed it our credentials. In \autoref{fig:HosInfo-login}, a screengrab of the HosInfo login gateway is shown. After feeding the login credentials, the WebDriver manually navigated to the login button and clicked it. This prompts a load before transitioning from the login page to the correct URL from where we could scrape the data, so we injected a manual waiting time of at most ten seconds until a unique element appeared. We simply chose a unique element at random and used its XPATH in the HTML code for identification. This is all to say that the webscraping solution is incredibly fragile and highly prone to the slightest changes made to the HosInfo application.

\end{figure}

By submitting our credentials and automatically navigating to the correct webpage, we could now extract it in full as an HTML file. Here, we opted for using the very standard solution of parsing the HTML file with the \texttt{bs4} package, more commonly known as \texttt{BeautifulSoup}. Parsing the HTML was, to our great luck, quite easy. Although the spreadsheet isn't formatted as an HTML \texttt{table}, every single cell, or entry, was the same division (\texttt{div}) with the class name: \emph{"single-description"}. Likewise, were the functions (the row labels) but instead with the class name: \emph{"single-function"}. As there were seven columns, one for each day of the week, we could iterate through our 1D array of entries but retain the 2D order by using the row indices:

\begin{equation*}
    \text{row\_index} = \text{entry\_index} \mod 7
\end{equation*}
and the column indices:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{column\_index} = \left\lfloor
        \frac{\text{entry\_index}}{7}
    \right\rfloor.
\end{equation*}
This doesn't exactly constitute as rocket-science; however, it was nice to be able to keep the index as some \emph{functions} (rows) didn't contain any relevant information, and others didn't change from week to week but introduced a large bug, when we attempted to include them. An example of rows that weren't relevant was the large entries describing that all units (agents) either were taking a course, had a planned vacation or another kind of time off, or that the agents were ill. When we initially tried to exclude some of these rows, we did it by their index, keeping a \gls{dictionary} of the function label to index translation. Alas, the indices didn't stay fixed and could change from week to week. This also introduced a large bug to our system, which we attempted to alleviate by simply skipping rows based on their label instead. The idea behind using indices rather than labels was a hope that, although the function label might be renamed, it would retain its index. Ideally, the solution wouldn't have to skip any rows, but seeing as that wasn't an option, our program was left vulnerable to function (row) label renaming.

Now, with all the preprocessing of the data, we had gone from a webpage with some entries in the form of a table to a full HTML file and all the way to a manageable 2D table (a \texttt{pandas} table in Python) with string entries and row labels. This brings us to the second glaring issue: HosInfo doesn't enforce any formatting of its entries. As such, we had to somehow arrive at a pattern for all the string entries constituting our data.
\\
In \autoref{tab:HosInfo-example-entries}, we give an example of some of the possible entries in HosInfo. Some of the formatting is extremely simple to spot for the human eye, and for a non-technically inclined individual, some of these entries probably read just fine. However, there is still a lot of ambiguity as to how it should be interpreted. In \autoref{tab:HosInfo-good-processing}, we give an example of what could probably be considered a good interpretation, and in \autoref{tab:HosInfo-poor-processing}, we provide an example of some of all the possible pitfalls a computer program might be prone to stumble into.

    \caption{HosInfo poor processing}
    \label{tab:HosInfo-poor-processing}
\end{table}

We loathe to admit it, but in order to have any fighting chance at formatting the strings, as shown in \autoref{tab:HosInfo-example-entries}, we elected to use regular expressions (regex). More precisely, we used the following regex pattern:
\begin{verbatim}
    ^([^\s(]+(?:_[^\s(]+)?)\s*(?:\(([^)]+)\))?\s*(.*)$
\end{verbatim}
This regex pattern essentially captures three groups. We will do our best to break it down. A good way to understand it is by dividing it into the following:
\begin{verbatim}
    ^
        ([^\s(]+(?:_[^\s(]+)?)   # (group 1)
        \s*
        (?:\(([^)]+)\))?         # (group 2, optional)
        \s*
        (.*)                     # (group 3)
    $
\end{verbatim}
Here, \verb|^| signifies the beginning of the string. \verb|([^\s(]+(?:_[^\s(]+)?)| captures \emph{group 1}. The first part, \verb|[^\s(]+|, captures "one or more characters that are not whitespace \verb|\s| and are not the character starting parenthesis \verb|(|"\footnote{This is the standard formulation employed for regular expressions.}. Then \verb|(?:_[^\s(]+)?| is a \emph{non-capturing} group, i.e. what it captures isn't a distinct group, but rather it adheres to a preexisting, in this case \emph{group 1}. It captures a group matched by the underscore character \verb|_| followed by "one or more non-whitespace, non-\verb|(| characters". However, this entire non-capturing group is optional, signified by the question mark character \verb|?|. The next line: \verb|\s*| is a standard expression which matches zero or more whitespace characters (effectively discarding them).
\\
Next, \verb|(?:\(([^)]+)\))?| is a second non-capturing group, which works in a somewhat peculiar way. It is also optional (again signified by the \verb|?|); however, if there is a closed parenthesis, given by a \verb|(| and a \verb|)| character, then this part of the expression \verb|([^)]+)| captures all characters which aren't the \verb|)| character, i.e. everything in the parenthesis. This is also followed by the standard: \verb|\s*|, discarding zero or more whitespace characters.
\\
Finally, what we have marked as \emph{group 3}: \verb|(.*)| simply captures everything else until the end of the string.
\\
In an attempt to explain it in a slightly more human fashion, we can classify the three groups as:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Group 1: Captures the name and the initials after the underscore, if present.
	\item Group 2: If a closed parenthesis exists, this captures its innards, i.e. this captures (the first) timeslot, if present.
	\item Group 3: This is anything after a potential closed parenthesis, or alternatively anything after the name, i.e. this captures any trailing appendages, e.g. this could be extra information as highlighted in \autoref{tab:HosInfo-good-processing}.
\end{enumerate}
Despite all the troubles it proved to try and process the HosInfo data, it, as previously alluded to,  still only tells half of the story. In order to show the complete picture and give the actual representation which OUH wanted, the HosInfo data needed to be merged with the data provided by a weekly ward assignment chart. The assignment chart was made with Microsoft Excel, so, in contrast to HosInfo, it was a piece of cake to simply load it into a \texttt{pandas} table, which could be manipulated in Python.
\\
Alas, here, the third glaring issue reared its head. Although easy to load into Python, merging the data from the assignment chart with the HosInfo data proved incredibly difficult. Firstly, the column at which the two 2D datasets should be compatible hadn't been given a standardised naming convention. This was the function column; the one presented as rows at HosInfo and which, as can be seen from \autoref{fig:wac-snippet} is a column in the assignment chart, which indicates what personnel are performing which tasks. An example of this incompatible naming convention could be a task in the assignment chart called \emph{'SHOULDER KIDS'}, while at HosInfo, it might be called \emph{'SHOULDER 1'}. Other times, the task had attached a timeframe in the label at one place, while not at the other, e.g. \emph{'KNEES until 14'} and simply \emph{'KNEES'}. However, the names referred to the same, but it is our understanding that different departments, or maybe more sections, at OUH had individually elected to name them. It is, in turn, also our understanding that although the naming wasn't standardised, this didn't lead to discrepancies for the healthcare staff and to them, the translation was obvious. Sometimes, it might have been because a task was accompanied by a doctor who specialised in working with kids, and therefore, that doctor performing \emph{'SHOULDER 1'} must match with the nurse in HosInfo assigned to \emph{'SHOULDER KIDS'}. Other times, it might have been because they had simply grown accustomed to a special label meaning the same as an enumeration, e.g. that \emph{'SKH HAND'} and \emph{'HAND 2'} is a match (where \emph{SKH} is an abbreviation for the danish \emph{emergency}).
\\
The only solution is obviously a translation. We had expected that we would have to maintain a \gls{dictionary} over the translations; however, to our great pleasure, OUH decided to try and standardise the naming between these two spreadsheets.
