\section{Methodology}
\subsection{First Steps - The Questionnaire}
Rather than researching some obscure nook or cranny of mathematics, this project was initially motivated by a desire to try and implement 5 years of education in order to assist with some current real-world problems. From prior work, we hypothesised that there might be quite a handful of such problems within the Danish healthcare sector. As such, we laid the groundwork in March of 2024 by sending out a questionnaire, which can be seen in appendix \autoref{fig:questionnaire_healthcare_personnel}, to \textbf{Rigshospitalet}, \textbf{The Hospital of Hvidovre}, \textbf{The regional Hospital of Northern Jutland}, \textbf{The University Hospital of Aalborg}, \textbf{Hospital unit Midt}, \textbf{The Hospital of Holb√¶k} and \textbf{The department of orthopaedic surgery at the University Hospital of Odense}. This was met with quite varying responses. Most deemed that answering such a questionnaire would be an abhorrent misuse of their personnel's limited time. This, admittedly, left us a bit discouraged. However, we still received a total of 39 answers from medical professionals.
\\
The questionnaire consisted of two questions\footnote{With the option to add your name and/or mail for possible further inquiry.}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the biggest and most frequent problem in your daily life as a healthcare professional?
    \item What do you think is the biggest and most frequent problem in the daily life of your patients?
\end{itemize}
The responses about the daily life and tasks of healthcare professionals varied significantly, but they could likely be summarised as a general dissatisfaction with the understaffed and underfunded state of the healthcare sector.
\\
Many complained about the intricate journaling processes - documenting the patients' treatment pathways, reading through a lot of unnecessary documentation and documenting the same thing twice. 
\\
There was a plethora of replies criticising the IT systems currently in place. Complaining that they either didn't work, were too slow or kept crashing. Additionally, one respondee noted that they have a lot of programs that advertise useful functionality, but because they aren't integrated with all the other individual solutions, the healthcare staff end up having to open multiple programs documenting the same data many times over.
\\
Some mentioned that there are a lot of wrongful queries to the emergency line that have to be redirected. It was also added that a filter or automatic redirection might save a lot of critical time.
\\
Finally, the vast majority of responses were aimed at a lack of resources. This included being understaffed, resulting in insufficient time to care for patients and individual staff members being assigned too many tasks. Additionally, there was a shortage of critical inventory, such as bed space and essential medical equipment. Moreover, the existing equipment was often old or outdated due to budget cuts.
\\
\\
The responses regarding the everyday problems of patients weren't nearly as varied. These were mainly regarding long waiting times and a lack of transparency. Out of 39 responses, 12 mentioned that patients had expressed concerns about unclear treatment pathways. Additionally, 18 out of 39 responses indicated that patients had complained about the length of the waiting times. Lastly, a handful of respondents (approximately 6) mentioned that their patients feel overlooked, which may also indicate an understaffed healthcare sector.
\\
\\
After reading the responses to our questionnaire and working in tandem with the healthcare sector for roughly six months, it has become undoubtedly apparent that the healthcare sector is in dire need of a digital revolution. A plethora of tasks could be expedited seamlessly without contributing additional burdens to the medical personnel if only proper digital solutions were implemented. However, we would have been unable to work on any practical application within the healthcare sector if all responses we had received were equally uninclined to collaborate. Therefore, we were overjoyed when the University Hospital of Odense (OUH) reached out with an incredibly accommodating response.

\subsection{The Digital Taskboard}
OUH responded that their department of Orthopaedic surgery uses a whiteboard as a daily taskboard. A picture of the current whiteboard is shown in \autoref{fig:Whiteboard-Taskboard}. However, this whiteboard is being drawn up daily by manually transcribing data from two distinct spreadsheets. OUH  informed us that the process usually takes 10-20 minutes, time that could be better spent on more critical tasks by the clinical staff, and as such, they wished for a digital replacement for the whiteboard. Therefore, this thesis began with the seemingly straightforward task of merging two 2D datasets and visualising them on a screen comparable to a whiteboard.
\\
For clarity, we would like to note that the two spreadsheets are separated purely for administrative purposes; the separation doesn't add any additional dimensionality. Hence, it can still be displayed without loss of dimensionality on a plane like a whiteboard or screen.

The two spreadsheets, which need to be merged in order to arrive at the correct data, consisted of a \emph{ward assignment chart}, in the form of a Microsoft Excel file and a web application made by a third party called HosInfo. A snippet of the ward assignment chart can be seen in \autoref{fig:wac-snippet}, and a snippet of the HosInfo interface can be seen in \autoref{fig:HosInfo-snippet}.
\\
The immediate issue was that none of the data was formatted. Additionally, the HosInfo application (which we will refer to onwards as HosInfo) didn't have an API, and it only has two access levels: surface-level access for viewing the data and full administrative control. As such, our only option was to scrape the HTML pages from HosInfo. Scraping was a wholly new endeavour for us, so we tried to start out using Python's inherent \texttt{requests} library. Here, we injected \emph{cookies} and a \emph{header} containing our login information. However, it would soon prove that what seemed to be a bug at first, was actually just not an automatic solution at all. The injected information would have to be updated regularly with a manual login for this approach to work. Therefore, we made a switch to the open-source, third-party tool \texttt{selenium}. \texttt{selenium} works by instantiating a WebDriver, which can automatically drive the browser. In short, this meant that we gave it instructions to navigate separately to the three specified text elements for login input and fed it our credentials. In \autoref{fig:HosInfo-login}, a screengrab of the HosInfo login gateway is shown. After feeding the login credentials, the WebDriver manually navigated to the login button and clicked it. This prompts a load before transitioning from the login page to the correct URL from where we could scrape the data, so we injected a manual waiting time of at most ten seconds until a unique element appeared. We simply chose a unique element at random and used its XPATH in the HTML code for identification. This is all to say that the webscraping solution is incredibly fragile and highly prone to the slightest changes made to the HosInfo application.
