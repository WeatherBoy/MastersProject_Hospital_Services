\section{Methodology}
Rather than researching some obscure nook or cranny of mathematics, this project was initially motivated by a desire to try and implement 5 years of education in order to assist with some current real-world problems. From prior work, we hypothesised that there might be quite a handful of such problems within the Danish healthcare sector\footnote{As we will detail later, we have yet to disprove this hypothesis completely.}. As such, we laid the groundwork in March of 2024 by sending out a questionnaire, which can be seen in appendix \autoref{fig:questionnaire_healthcare_personnel}, to \textbf{Rigshospitalet}, \textbf{The Hospital of Hvidovre}, \textbf{The region hospital of Northern Jutland}, \textbf{The University Hospital of Aalborg}, \textbf{Hospital-unit Midt}, \textbf{The Hospital of Holb√¶k} and \textbf{The department of orthopaedic surgery at the University Hospital of Odense}. This was met with quite varying responses. Most deemed that answering such a questionnaire would be an abhorrent misuse of their personnel's limited time. This, admittedly, left us a bit discouraged. However, the University Hospital of Odense reached out with an incredibly accommodating response.
