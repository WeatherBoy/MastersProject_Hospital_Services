\section*{Preface and Acknowledgements}
This project is written as part of the Master of Science in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Denmark, Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. Professor Aasa Feragen supervised this project. The project was completed from the 2nd of September 2024 to the 9th of March 2025. All the code supporting the project is in the GitHub repository \github{https://github.com/WeatherBoy/MastersProject_Hospital_Services}\footnote{For completeness: \href{https://github.com/WeatherBoy/MastersProject_Hospital_Services}{https://github.com/WeatherBoy/MastersProject\_Hospital\_Services}.}.

I want to thank Aasa Feragen for her guidance in the project's overall direction. Furthermore, I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Annie Gam-Pedersen for not only acting as a liaison between me and OUH during the entire project but for without whom this project would never have been more than a questionnaire and a hope. Another huge thanks goes to the OUH staff, particularly Katrine and Rikke, for enduring my shenanigans.
I would also like to thank Malthe \O rberg Gedsted and Tobias Drue for their tenacity in providing mission-critical feedback throughout the entire writing process.
Lastly, I would like to give my sincerest thanks to Tobias Drue, Rasmus Molsted and Jakob Kammeyer, for without whom and their unyielding support, I would almost assuredly have succumbed to despair.
